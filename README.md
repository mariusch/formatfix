# FormatFix
### Abbreviates the Numeric Value mode of the Status Text
Changes `1234/5678` to just `1234` when using the Numeric Value mode of the Status Text setting under Display.

### Hybrid Mode
You can enable/disable a hybrid HP | percentage HP mode which is useful for boss fights (enrage at 20% for example).

### Font
FormatFix also allows for customization of font type and font size.<br/>
Font type is hard coded in line 1 of `FormatFix.lua` for now - will be customizable in-game later.<br/>

### Dependencies
