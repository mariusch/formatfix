# FormatFix
## Abbreviates the Numeric Value mode of the Status Text
Changes 1234/5678 to just 1234 when using the Numeric Value mode of the Status Text setting under Display.

## Hybrid Mode
You can disable a hybrid HP | percentage HP mode which is useful for boss fights (enrage at 20% for example).
This is enabled/disabled with `/ff percent enable` and `/ff percent disable`

## Font
Also allows for customization of font type and font size.

Font size can be set with `/ff fontsize <number>`

Font type is hard coded in line 1 of `main.lua` for now - will be customizable with commands later.
